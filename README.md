This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to calibrate and analyze data from the *Hubble Space Telescope* (*HST*) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Users are advised to visit the [ACS website](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs), [Instrument Handbook](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/handbooks/current/cover.html), and [Data Handbook](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/acs_cover.html) for more information about the current status of ACS, instrument specifications, and data analysis.

Users who need help transitioning from IRAF/PyRAF to Python should see the [stak-notebooks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stak-notebooks) repository. 

If you have questions about HST data analysis, calibration software, instrument capabilities, and/or the methods discussed in this repository, please visit the [HST Help Desk](http://hsthelp.stsci.edu). Through the help desk portal, you can explore the HST Knowledge Base and request additional help from experts.
