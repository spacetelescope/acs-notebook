    "\n",
    "Despite being in orbit, HST imaging data still suffers from contamination by artificial satellites that can compromise science data unless they are identified and masked. This notebook presents examples of how to identify satellite trails in ACS/WFC data. The routine is also effective at identifying other linear features duch as <a href=\"https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/acsdhb/files/60243156/60243162/1/1567011208101/acs_Ch46.2.jpg\">diffraction spikes</a> and <a href=\"https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/acsdhb/chapter-4-acs-data-processing-considerations/4-5-image-anomalies\">glint</a> (see <a href=\"https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/acsdhb/chapter-4-acs-data-processing-considerations/4-5-image-anomalies\">Section 4.5 of the ACS DHB</a> for further discussion on these artifacts). \n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of the algorithm is provided in <a href=\"https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr2208.pdf\">ACS ISR 2022-08</a>. To briefly summarize, the Median Radon Transform (MRT) is calculated for an input image and used to identify linear signals in the data. The MRT is similar to the standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform\">Radon Transform</a> except that it calculates the median, rather than the sum, of data along all possible paths through an image. This modification makes the algorithm more robust against false signals from localized sources (e.g., stars, galaxies) but still very sensitive to persistent linear features, even well-below the background noise level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional post-processing is done to filter out spurious detections, primarily eliminating them based on trail S/N, width, and persistence across the image. These parameters, especially the maximum allowed trail width, are tuned for ACS/WFC data binned 2x2 and may be different for images from other instruments. Once the final set of trails is identified and characterized, a mask can be created. The routine provides numerous ways of visualizing the results, as will be demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples illustrate how to use `acstools.findsat_mrt` to identify satellite trails and then create masks for them. Examples 1 and 4 go through the analysis step by step, including how to preprocess data and run individual routines inside `findsat_mrt`. Examples 2, 3, and 5 demonstrate how to automate many of these steps. Our demonstrations stop at the creation of the masks. We leave it to the user to decide the best way to apply the masks to their own analysis."

The keywords being saved here were chosen to ensure we know the original exposure ippsoot and which chip was analyzed. Additional keywords are saved that store information about the orientation of the telescope when the image was taken. In principle, the user can save any header keywords they like. We have also set `plot=False` in this example, so we can demonstrate how to manually create plots. Setting `plot=True` will automatically generate plots after specific processes are finished.

It also contains the additional routines that read the image, rebin, mask, and subtract the background. By default, these will be run automatically when WfcWrapper is initialized, although this can be turned off. In most cases, you probably will only need to adjust the `binsize` keyword. The specific value of `binsize` is up to the user. Larger values speed up the MRT calculation, but keep in mind that the parameters to filter out spurious trails (e.g., `max_width`) are tuned to WFC data binned 2x2. A user may want to start with a larger value for `binsize` and reduce it once they get a sense for the computation time."
